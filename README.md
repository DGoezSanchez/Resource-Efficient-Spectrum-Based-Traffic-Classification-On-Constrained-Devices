# **  MTL Development Cycle Using TensorRT for Inference   **
-------------------------


This repository contains the information and algorithms presented in the paper "Resource-Efficient-Spectrum-Based-Traffic-Classification-On-Constrained-Devices." In this work, we propose a novel methodology that exploits expert knowledge in combination with recent advances in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) optimization to allow spectrum-based TC systems to run on constrained devices. This paper proposes a well-defined and innovative methodology for resource-efficient, spectrum-based TC to address this issue, combining MTL with DNN optimization techniques.
